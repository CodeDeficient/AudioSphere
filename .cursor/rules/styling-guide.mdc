# Styling Guide

This project uses Tailwind CSS along with custom CSS variables defined in [src/app/globals.css](mdc:src/app/globals.css).

The `globals.css` file defines custom properties for colors and gradients, such as `--button-gradient-1`, `--text-color`, and `--foreground`.

It also includes a global background animation and a `glassmorphism` class for applying a frosted glass effect to elements.
